            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <h4>I am a passionate Computer Scientist with interests in Software Engineering, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and Web Development. I am always personable and outgoing.
              Additionally, WPI's many group projects have made me confident in my ability to lead as well as increase cohesivity within any team. I am motivated by my group members, and always
              want to exceed their expectations. My greatest programming strength is solving complex problems through careful scrutinty and research even when I lack experience in the subject. 
              Although my programming proficiencies are defined below, I can quickly improve and learn new languages while developing.
